# Hudir La Flota - Battleship
## Description
This project implements the Battleship game in Java using a Swing GUI and an MVC architecture. This project also helped me to practice Object Oriented Programming concepts such as inheritance, singleton patterns, factory patterns etc. 

## Development Methodology
This project was developed using the SCRUM Agile methodology, which consists of dividing the project into Sprints where a certain amount of work is planned for each Sprint and a due date is set for it. After those Sprints the team gathers together with the client to inform on the progress of the project and re-evaluate any concerns the client may have. This planning and process can be found in the documentation below.
